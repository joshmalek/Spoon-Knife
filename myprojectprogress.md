Write about your thoughts on possible projects of interest and how you would like to organize it. Common repository? Blessed repository? Other?

I was considering doing data analytics for games, along the lines of player gameplay optimization and helping players focus on what to improve through data.

I would probably use a blessed repository, where everyone uses the central repo as a reference, with only me allowed to push changes into the central repo.
